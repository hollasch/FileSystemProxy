FileSystemProxy - _**Deprecated**_
====================================================================================================

Originally this was a C++ class to proxy the file system on Windows, Mac and Linux, and support mock
filesystems for testing. However, with C++'s new `std::filesystem`, this doesn't appear to be
necessary any longer.

I'll leave it here as an interesting discarded project, but there's no reason to use this any more.
