FileSystemProxy
====================================================================================================

Originally this was a C++ class to proxy the file system on Windows, Mac and Linux. However, with
C++'s new std::filesystem, this doesn't appear to be necessary any longer.

I'm leaving it up for a little bit more, but will probably delete this in the end.
